Final Exam Week Assignment
## Final Assignment: Blood Management System
- This is your final assignment for the course where you have learned Django, Django Rest

- Framework (DRF), and React. You are required to build a Blood Management System as a full-stack project. React is optional - students may either use React for the frontend or Django templates for the UI. The project should demonstrate your understanding of backend API development, authentication, database models, and frontend integration (with React or Django templates).

## Assignment Requirements:
- User Authentication (Register, Login, Logout) using Django or DRF authentication.
- Two main roles: Admin and Donor.
- Admin Features: Manage blood banks, donors, blood requests, and approve/reject blood donations.
- Donor Features: Register as a donor, update profile, make a blood donation request, and view donation history.
- Backend APIs built using Django Rest Framework for all core functionalities.
- Frontend can be built using either React (consuming APIs) OR Django templates.
- Dashboard for Donor: Show donor’s info, available blood groups, and donation history.
- Dashboard for Admin: Show overall statistics (e.g., total donors, available blood units by group, pending requests).
- Search/Filter functionality: Search donors by blood group and availability.
- Validation on both frontend and backend (valid blood group, prevent duplicates, etc.).
- Responsive design (if frontend is React or if templates are styled with Bootstrap/CSS).
- Optional but Highly Recommended: Deploy your project to a live server (e.g., Render, PythonAnywhere, Railway, or Vercel).

## Optional Extra Features (For Bonus Marks):
- Email notifications: Notify donors when their donation is approved or when blood of their group is needed.
- Blood request tracking: Allow users to check the status of their request (pending, approved, rejected).
- Role for Hospitals: Hospitals can place blood requests directly.
- Analytics: Show charts/graphs of blood availability and donation trends (can use chart libraries in React or Django plugins).
- Multi-language support (English + Bangla or another language).
- Profile photo upload for donors.
- Search donors by location (city/area).

## Deliverables:
- Complete backend (Django + DRF) project with APIs.
- Frontend (React app or Django templates) connected with backend.
- Database with proper models and migrations.
- README file explaining how to run the project.
- At least 3–5 screenshots or a short demo video showing the functionality.
- Live deployed link of your project (if hosted).

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness and completeness of features.
- Code quality and organization (clean, reusable, well-documented code).
- Proper use of Django/DRF for backend API development.
- Frontend integration (React or Django templates).
- UI/UX design and responsiveness.
- Validation and error handling.
- Creativity and additional useful features (bonus points).
- Successfully hosting the project on a live server.

This assignment combines everything you have learned during the course. You can choose to use

React or Django templates for the frontend. Work individually, ensure your project runs without errors, and submit before the deadline. 

# Good luck!
